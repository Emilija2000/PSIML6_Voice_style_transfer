# PSIML6 Voice Style Transfer

This was a two-person project done on Summer School of Machine Learning organized by Microsoft Development Center Serbia. 

The objective of the project is Neural Style Transfer done on audio files. The project included the implementation of the StarGAN neural network architecture, in order to acchive many-to-many style transfer, applied on sound spectrograms. The neural network consisted of mostly convolutional generator, discriminator, as well as the pretrained mainly convolutional classifier.
